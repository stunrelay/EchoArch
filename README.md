📦 Installation

    Copy the EchoArch/ folder into your RetroArch overlays/gamepads directory.

    In RetroArch:

        Go to Settings > On-Screen Display > On-Screen Overlay

        Choose your preferred EchoArch overlay

    ⚙️ Setup recommendations:

        Try Standard resolution first. If it looks vertically stretched in portrait, switch to Taller.

        Turn off Auto-Scale (only turn it on if scaling looks wrong)

        Overlay opacity: 1.00 for proper animation display

        Fullscreen Over Notch: Off (recommended to avoid covering camera cutouts)

🖼️ Screenshots

    Note: Scaling may look different depending on your device.
